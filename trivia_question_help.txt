Hello!

--- Question types ---
There are currently two question types, --standard-- and --multiple choice--.
Any question with the value "n" in the is_multiple_choice column in the spreadsheet is STANDARD, otherwise the question is MULTIPLE CHOICE.

For --multiple choice questions--, the answers column is a list of possible choices, with the first being the correct one.

For --standard questions--, the answers column is a list of possible correct answers that the player could type.

--- Editing ---
To add more questions, go to data/trivia_questions.xlsx.
Use ALT+ENTER to add new lines in a cell.
To separate answers, you can use a combination of new lines or ;;.

--- Saving ---
You can save the excel spreadsheet whenever you like, it doesn't affect the bot.

When you want to push your changes to the bot, use Save As to save the file as trivia_questions.csv, making use to USE THE FORMAT "CSV UTF-8 (Comma Delimited)".

Once you have saved as a .csv, make sure you switch back to the .xlsx before making changes.
