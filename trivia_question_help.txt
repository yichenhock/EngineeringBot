Hello!

To add more questions, go to data/trivia_questions.xlsx.

You can save the excel spreadsheet whenever you like, it doesn't affect the bot.

When you want to push your changes to the bot, use Save As to save the file as trivia_questions.csv, making use to USE THE FORMAT "CSV UTF-8 (Comma Delimited)".

Once you have saved as a .csv, make sure you switch back to the .xlsx before making changes.
