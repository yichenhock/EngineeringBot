materials,4,Part 1A Materials Handout 4: Microstructure and Properties,"The contribution to the yield stress due to **dislocation pinning** depends directly on G, b, L, and α.
Which of these properties can be manipulated by composition and processing and which are fixed parameters?",,y,"L and α can be manipulated, b and G are fixed.
L and b can be manipulated, G and α are fixed.
G and α can be manipulated, L and b are fixed.
L and G can be manipulated, b and α are fixed.
G and b can be manipulated, L and α are fixed.","G = elastic shear modulus, b = Burgers vector (atomic spacing), L = obstacle spacing, α = obstacle strength"

structures,10,Part 1A Structures Handout 6: Stresses Elastic Beams,"When you transform wood (with modulus `E_w`) into steel (with modulus `E_s`) for analysis of composite beams made up of wood and steel, what happens to the width of the transformed section of wood?",,y,"Gets shorter by a factor of `E_w/E_s`
Doesn't change
Gets wider by a factor of `E_s/E_w`
Gets shorter by a factor of `E_s`
Gets shorter by a factor of `E_w`","We take the bending stiffness `B=EI` to be constant for both wood and steel, where `I = (b*d^3)/12` for rectangular sections. By rearranging `E_w*I_w = E_s*I_s` you can find that the width of wood, for which `E_w<E_s` is reduced by a factor of `E_w/E_s` when transformed into steel. "
